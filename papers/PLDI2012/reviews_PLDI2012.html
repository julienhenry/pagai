This paper discusses techniques for (more precise) path-by-path<br>abstract interpretation of numerical program properties. In the first<br>part (sections 3 and 4), the paper discusses how to combine algorithms<br>from [16] and [26], and then [17]. In the second part of the paper,<br>the previous algorithms and combinations are compared experimentally.<br><br><br>
          >>> Evaluation <<<

The combination of the techniques of [16], [26] and [17] is<br>interesting, although rather unsurprising.<br><br>The experimental evaluation is also interesting, although the overall<br>results are again unsurprising (the more precise combinations, like<br>G+PF and DIS, are also the more expensive -- see Table 3).

          >>> Summary of the submission <<<

The paper takes two existing analyses -- (1) Guided Static Analysis, a<br>technique to improve widening precision by incrementally processing<br>increasing subsets of program paths; and (2) Path Focusing, a<br>technique for path-sensitive program analysis based on SMT solvers --<br>and combines them into a new analysis that uses SMT solving to<br>incrementally process increasing subsets of executable program paths.<br><br>The paper empirically evaluates the new technique against the two<br>existing techniques, showing increased precision while remaining<br>within the same order of magnitude of performance. It also evaluates<br>the effect on precision of varying the abstract domain of the analysis<br>while keeping the analysis technique constant.<br><br><br>
          >>> Evaluation <<<

The paper is well written and makes a solid contribution. I was not<br>familiar with guided static analysis or path focusing before now<br>(though the background section did a good job explaining them); my<br>understanding of the paper is:<br><br>1. The problem with guided static analysis is that it will eventually<br>process all paths in the control-flow graph, including non-executable<br>paths, thus losing precision.<br><br>2. The problem with path focusing is that (1) it will process all<br>executable paths at once, including potentially many redundant paths<br>that don't contribute to the solution; and (2) its widening operation<br>lacks the precision conferred by guided static analysis.<br><br>Therefore, by combining these two techniques we get an analysis that<br>will only examine 'interesting' executable paths that will contribute<br>to the analysis solution, and one that still benefits from the<br>widening procedure of guided static analysis, thus getting the best of<br>both worlds.<br><br>The benefits are empirically evaluated in terms of numerical abstract<br>domains (intervals, convex polyhedra, etc). It would be interesting to<br>see how much benefit this technique confers to other types of abstract<br>domains, including those that don't require widening (e.g., pointer<br>analysis). This possible use is only briefly mentioned at the very end<br>of the paper; I'd like to know more about how applicable the technique<br>is to other kinds of abstract domains (e.g., is it a straight-forward<br>extension or does it require further research? How much benefit might<br>be expected?).<br><br>Empirical evaluation:<br><br>-- Since the implemented analyses are all intraprocedural, it would be<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;useful to know something about the sizes of the functions in the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;benchmarks<br><br>-- I was expecting that a conclusion would be drawn based on the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;empirical results about the relative merits of increasing precision<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;using more precise techniques or more precise abstract<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;domains. Instead, these two questions are treated completely<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;independently. The evaluation of different abstract domains thus<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;feels rather tacked on and divorced from the rest of the paper.<br><br>Some notes about mistakes/ambiguities:<br><br>-- On page 3, in the code listing just below the figure on top of the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;right column: the last 'else' should not be there<br><br>-- In Algorithm 1, the variables I_p and I_p_i are used but not<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;defined anywhere in the paper<br><br>-- At the beginning of section 4, m_i is used but not defined until<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;much later in the section<br><br>-- Throughout the paper 'we' and 'our' is used ambiguously, sometimes<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;to describe existing work and sometimes to describe the current<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;work. Occasionally I had to figure out whether whatever was being<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;described was something new to this paper or previously existing.<br><br><br>

          >>> Summary of the submission <<<

Abstract interpretation is a continuous struggle to finding the sweet<br>spot between precision and performance and scalability. Recent<br>advancements on SMT solving, guided static analysis, and path-focusing<br>techniques, the many-fold abstract domains they can be combined with<br>including intervals, octagons, and polyhedra to quote only those<br>advancements being relevant for the present submission make the<br>informed choice of which technique to apply when for a given set of<br>requirements on precision and performance ever more difficult.<br><br>The present paper aims at improving on this situation by (re-)<br>implementing and integrating SMT solving, guided static analysis, and<br>path-focusing techniques in a uniform prototype tool and comparing<br>then the efficacy of various combinations thereof on a set of open<br>source code projects like grep, gzip, tar, and others. Additionally,<br>it presents and investigates a new variant combining preferable<br>features from guided static analysis and path-focusing technique.<br><br>
          >>> Evaluation <<<

In principle, I like the approach presented in this paper very<br>much. The author(s) made quite a good job in making a lot of<br>state-of-the-art analysis techniques for computing disjunctive<br>invariants available in a form allowing to compare their relative<br>efficacy in the same setting. I am bit disappointed, however, about<br>the conclusions drawn from the many practical experiments. Of course,<br>it were naive to expect as an outcome of these experiments a total<br>ordering between the various approaches. However, a set of guidelines<br>suggesting the usage of one approach over another in terms of if-what<br>scenarios would be very desirable. Maybe the differences observed<br>between the various approaches (usually some 2 or 5% difference) are<br>too small in order to allow for such rules, and might also be too<br>small in order to trace the reasons for these differences back to a<br>set of roots. Without something like that, however, the numbers<br>obtained in the experiments are of limited usability. 2 to 5%<br>difference, does it make a difference at all? If so, for which<br>problems or e.g. transformations based on top of these analysis<br>results? As currently presented, the findings and conclusions drawn<br>from them do not really help.<br><br>A problem of the presentation might also be that on the one hand side<br>the paper aims at comparing a set of competing state-of-the-art<br>approaches, on the other hand, it proposes a new variant being a<br>mixture of features of those and including it in the comparison.<br>Maybe this is too much for a single paper.<br><br>Last but not least, is the title of the paper accurate? From the<br>abstract and introduction, I would have expected something like<br>Disjunctive program analysis: When to use which technique why?<br><br>Nonetheless, the paper makes an interesting contribution.<br><br>Details:<br>- p.4, r.c., top: there is no paths -&gt; there are<br>- p.4, r.c., top: there exist a path -&gt; exists<br>- p.4, r.c., bottom: lead us to a -&gt; leads us<br>- p.5, r.c., top: on a ascending -&gt; on an<br>- p.5, r.c., top: for each control points -&gt; point<br>- p.6, l.c., top: and bounded by -&gt; and is bounded by<br><br><br>
