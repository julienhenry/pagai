Our method eschews two traditional sources of imprecision: (i) the use of widening operators for enforcing convergence within a finite number of iterations (ii) the use of merge operations (often, convex hulls) at the merge points of the control flow graph. It instead computes the least inductive invariant expressible in the domain at a restricted set of program points, and analyzes the rest of the code en bloc. We emphasize that we compute this inductive invariant precisely. For that we extend the strategy improvement algorithm of [Gawlitza and Seidl, 2007]. If we applied their method directly, we would have to solve an exponentially sized system of abstract semantic equations, resulting in memory exhaustion. Instead, we keep the system implicit and discover strategy improvements using SAT modulo real linear arithmetic (SMT). For evaluating strategies we use linear programming. Our algorithm has low polynomial space complexity and performs for contrived examples in the worst case exponentially many strategy improvement steps; this is unsurprising, since we show that the associated abstract reachability problem is Pi-p-2-complete.}}

In this article, we describe how to avoid such systematic exploration by focusing on a single path at a time, designated by SMT-solving. Our method combines well with acceleration techniques, thus doing away with widenings as well in some cases. We illustrate it over the well-known domain of convex polyhedra.}

  Abstract = {In the context of static analysis via abstract
              interpretation, convex polyhedra constitute the most
              used abstract domain among those capturing numerical
              relational information.  Since the domain of convex
              polyhedra admits infinite ascending chains, it has to be
              used in conjunction with appropriate mechanisms for
              enforcing and accelerating the convergence of fixpoint
              computations.  Widening operators provide a simple and
              general characterization for such mechanisms.  For the
              domain of convex polyhedra, the original widening
              operator proposed by Cousot and Halbwachs amply deserves
              the name of \emph{standard widening} since most analysis
              and verification tools that employ convex polyhedra also
              employ that operator.  Nonetheless, there is an
              unfulfilled demand for more precise widening operators.
              In this paper, after a formal introduction to the
              standard widening where we clarify some aspects that are
              often overlooked, we embark on the challenging task of
              improving on it.  We present a framework for the
              systematic definition of new widening operators that are
              never less precise than a given widening.  The framework
              is then instantiated on the domain of convex polyhedra
              so as to obtain a new widening operator that improves on
              the standard widening by combining several heuristics.
              A preliminary experimental evaluation has yielded
              promising results.  We also suggest an improvement to
              the well-known widening delay technique that allows to
              gain precision while preserving its overall
              simplicity.},
