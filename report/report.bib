                  program analysis can be made efficient and precise
                  enough to formally verify a class of properties for
                  a family of large programs with few or no false
                  alarms. This is achieved by refinement of a general
                  purpose static analyzer and later adaptation to
                  particular programs of the family by the end-user
                  through parametrization. This is applied to the
                  proof of soundness of data manipulation operations
                  at the machine level for periodic synchronous safety
                  critical embedded software. The main novelties are
                  the design principle of static analyzers by
                  refinement and adaptation through parametrization,
                  the symbolic manipulation of expressions to improve
                  the precision of abstract transfer functions,
                  ellipsoid, and decision tree abstract domains, all
                  with sound handling of rounding errors in floating
                  point computations, widening strategies (with
                  thresholds, delayed) and the automatic determination
                  of the parameters (parametrized packing).},
