	* Bugfixes to the "pipe" interface, which now works with Z3 (style some typing bugs), SMTinterpol and MathSAT 5 (#if in SMTlib.h)

	* Ported to LLVM-3.1 (3.0 still works), Z3-4.0, CUDD-2.5.0,
	Yices-1.0.34 and a snapshot 2012-05-14 of APRON

2012-05-14  David MONNIAUX  <david@etale>

	* Fix in SMTLIB2 printing: floating-point value -0.0 must be
	printed as 0.0, -0.0 causes a syntax error in Z3.

	* external/ now downloads an Apron tarball (2012-05-14)
	from the Pagai Forge site, obtained from Apron svn.
	Solves two problems:
	- Apron 0.9.10 contains bugs fixed in svn
	- the Apron site no longer has Apron 0.9.10 !?
