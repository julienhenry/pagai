	* Fix in SMTLIB2 printing: floating-point value -0.0 must be
	printed as 0.0, -0.0 causes a syntax error in Z3.

	* external/ now downloads an Apron tarball (2012-05-14)
	from the Pagai Forge site, obtained from Apron svn.
	Solves two problems:
	- Apron 0.9.10 contains bugs fixed in svn
	- the Apron site no longer has Apron 0.9.10 !?
