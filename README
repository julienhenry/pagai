PAGAI needs :

- Apron: on Debian systems, install packages

  libapron libapron-dev libapron-ocaml-dev
  libmpfr-dev libgmp3-dev

- Yices, Z3, CUDD, LLVM (can be automatically installed for you)

The simplest way to compile PAGAI is to run:

  ./autoinstall.sh

from the toplevel. This will download and compile most dependencies
for you (it takes time, and ~550Mb of disk space).

If you don't want the dependencies to be installed for you, run:

  cmake .
  make
  
from the toplevel.

Alternatively, one can use an out-of-tree build with:

  mkdir build
  ../autoinstall-out-of-tree.sh

or, without the external dependency installation:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make

Variables (path to libraries, build options, ...) can be set for each
build with e.g.

  cmake -DSTATIC_LINK=ON .
  cmake -i .
  cmake-gui .
