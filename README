PAGAI needs :

- Apron: on Debian systems, install packages

  libapron libapron-dev libapron-ocaml-dev

- Yices, Z3, CUDD, LLVM (can be automatically installed for you)

To compile PAGAI, run

cmake .
make

from the toplevel.

Alternatively, one can use an out-of-tree build with

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

Variables (path to libraries, build options, ...) can be set for each
build with e.g.

cmake -DSTATIC_LINK=ON .
cmake -i .
cmake-gui .
