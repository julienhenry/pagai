PAGAI needs:

- GMP and MPFR. On Debian systems, install packages:

  libmpfr-dev libgmp3-dev

- CMake, for the compilation. On Debian systems, install packages:

  cmake
  
  (you may want to install cmake-gui too for a graphical configuration
  tool)

- Yices, Z3, CUDD, LLVM, Apron and the PPL (can be automatically
  installed for you). See the top of external/Makefile for required
  versions of these tools. In particular, Pagai won't work if you
  don't have the exact version of LLVM.

- curl or wget, if you want automatic dependencies installation.

The simplest way to compile PAGAI is to run:

  ./autoinstall.sh

from the toplevel. This will download and compile most dependencies
for you (it takes time, and ~550Mb of disk space).

If you don't want the dependencies to be installed for you, run:

  cmake .
  make
  
from the toplevel.

Alternatively, one can use an out-of-tree build with:

  mkdir build
  ../autoinstall-out-of-tree.sh

or, without the external dependency installation:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make

Variables (path to libraries, build options, ...) can be set for each
build with e.g.

  cmake -DSTATIC_LINK=ON .
  cmake -i .
  cmake-gui .
